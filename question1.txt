Question 1 

Q1.1 
    1. let a = 1 is global scope 
    2. var b = 2 is local scope 
    3. let c = 3 is block scope 
    4. let d = 10 is block scope 
    5. var c = 20 is global scope 

Q1.2
    The first output is 6 because the code in line 8 prints the values a + b + c, wich are 1 + 2 + 3, as declared in lines 1, 4, and 6. 
    The second output corresponds to the code in line 10, which is a + b. This is 1 + 2, which equals 3. 
    The next output is 1, due to the code in line 15, which outputs its value. 
    Then, the code outputs the value of c, which is now 20, since it was redeclared using var in  line 12. The c inside the function is block scoped, which can't be accessed outside. Thus, we use the new c value.
    Finally, line 17 outputs an error when trying to print the value of d since its value is declared inside the function myFunction() in line 7 and thus is block scoped, meaning we cannot access it outside.
